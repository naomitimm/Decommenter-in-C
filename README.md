# Decommenter-in-C

you can start the file main.c by using gcc -o main main.c OR gcc main.c -o main  

To start interacting with the code, you can run it by saying ./main then filename that is like ./main FILENAME. eg: ./main hello.txt

To output the decommented file to another file it can easily done by saying, ./main FILENAME > output.txt

So the output.txt is the DECOMMENTED file. without no comment.
